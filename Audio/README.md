Only one of the greatest and most famous piano works of all time, here
is Scott Joplin‘s “The Entertainer,” as performed by the American
composer himself. More than stand the test of time, this unforgettable
theme has become part of the very DNA of popular music, rediscovered by
every generation since its conception. From its first run as a piano roll
hit, through a chart topping radio resurgence in 1974 (precipitated by a
prominent use in the hit Paul Newman / Robert Redford movie The Sting),
to its ubiquitous presence on the loudspeakers of ice cream trucks the
world over, this piece is synonymous with joy and fun.
